#  AUTO_LCD_TEXT_SCROLLER

## INTRODUCTION:

The "LCD AUTO-TEXT SCROLLER" project is built to display the user given text or any messages in the LCD diplay pannel. People can see the LCD displaypannel and know the message. This circuit can be placed in any place they want, and it can be very helpful for public relavented applicances.

In todayâ€™s world, there is continuous need automatic appliance will be increase in standard of living, there is also one of developing circuit that would ease the complexity of life. 

This Project is useful in developing countries and this project has a bright future.
And this project is already used in many Stores, Hospitals, Hotels, Railway stations, Bus stops, Super market and many companies, industries. This project can also used with any sensors or other components to display their output on LCD display pannel for any alert messages or other purposes.

## OBJECTIVES:

* This project is built on the motive of screening the automatic scrolling text message on LCD pannel. People can know the information of an product and any alert messages whereever they in, without asking any others using this device. 

* This circuit can be used to display the messages by an automatictext scrolling LCD pannel with (or) without time delay at any place, and it can be fixed anywhere, depending on user decision and it is simple and light weighted.

## COMPONENTS:

* ATMEGA328

* POTENTIOMETER

* 16x2 LCD DISPLAY

* BREADBOARD

* JUMPER WIRES
