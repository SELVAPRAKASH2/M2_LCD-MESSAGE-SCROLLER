# ** AUTO LCD TEXT SCROLLER**

## INTRODUCTION:

The "LCD AUTO-TEXT SCROLLER" project is built to display the user given text or any messages in the LCD diplay pannel. People can see the LCD displaypannel and know the message. This circuit can be placed in any place they want, and it can be very helpful for public relavented applicances.

In todayâ€™s world, there is continuous need automatic appliance will be increase in standard of living, there is also one of developing circuit that would ease the complexity of life. 

This Project is useful in developing countries and this project has a bright future.
And this project is already used in many Stores, Hospitals, Hotels, Railway stations, Bus stops, Super market and many companies, industries. This project can also used with any sensors or other components to display their output on LCD display pannel for any alert messages or other purposes.

## OBJECTIVES:

* This project is built on the motive of screening the automatic scrolling text message on LCD pannel. People can know the information of an product and any alert messages whereever they in, without asking any others using this device. 

* This circuit can be used to display the messages by an automatictext scrolling LCD pannel with (or) without time delay at any place, and it can be fixed anywhere, depending on user decision and it is simple and light weighted.

## COMPONENTS:

* ATMEGA328

* POTENTIOMETER

* 16x2 LCD DISPLAY

* BREADBOARD

* JUMPER WIRES


## ATMEGA MICROCONTROLLER :

The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software-selectable power-saving modes.


## POTENTIOMETER :

A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.


## LCD-HD44780:

The Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller is an alphanumeric dot matrix liquid crystal display (LCD) controller developed by Hitachi in the 1980s. The character set of the controller includes ASCII characters, Japanese Kana characters, and some symbols in two 28 character lines. Using an extension driver, the device can display up to 80 characters.[1] The HD44780 is one of the most popular character LCDs ever made, with numerous third-party displays using its 16-pin interface and instruction set for compatibility.

## ADVANTAGES :

* Easy to express the message to all at the same time.

* Save timing and man power.

* No need of Inernet.

* Less power consumption.

* Light weighted.

* Can work 24x7 without any problem.

* Low cost and very easy to implement.

* Auto scrolling with (or) without time delay.

* Used for advertisement purpose.

## DISADVANTAGES :

* Power dependent.

* Limited number of text is displayed in small screen.

* Not an IOT or Wireless device.

## CONCLUSION :
 This device will helpful for many public applicances, such as to display any Breaking news, alert messages or any product price and details, railway stations and companies to tell any important messages to their whole employes.
 With this project we can pass the message to all the people, who are all watching this device without any distraction. This will save the time, energy and money.
